    <p>Ping someone is a good way to tell them something even if they&#39;re offline however the way discord makes notifications about pings makes it hard to understand when you ping badly</p>
    <p><strong>Editing your message to have a ping makes it glow but dose not ping or send a notification</strong></p>
  <h2 id="bad-pings">Bad pings</h2>
    <p>A ping in separate from your message makes it look weird in a notification</p>
    <p>This looks bad and dose not get your message across

    <p>Text: <code>@awashcard0</code></p>
    <p>All that shows up in the notification that you pinging</p>
  <h2 id="good-ping">Good ping</h2>
    <p>A good ping includes the ping and then your message</p>
    <p>This makes it easy to understand what you&#39;re trying to say

    <p>Text: <code>@everyone Happy New Years! ðŸ¥³</code></p>
    <p>You can hide your ping as well: <code>Happy New Years! ðŸ¥³ ||@everyone||</code></p>
    <p>This way your whole message shows up in the notification</p>
