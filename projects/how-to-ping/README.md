# How to ping someone
Ping someone is a good way to tell them something even if they're offline however the way discord makes notifications about pings makes it hard to understand when you ping badly

**Editing your message to have a ping makes it glow but dose not ping or send a notification**

## Bad pings
A ping in separate from your message makes it look weird in a notification

This looks bad and dose not get your message across

Text: `@awashcard0`

All that shows up in the notification that you pinging

## Good ping
A good ping includes the ping and then your message

This makes it easy to understand what you're trying to say

Text: `@everyone Happy New Years! ðŸ¥³`

You can hide your ping as well: `Happy New Years! ðŸ¥³ ||@everyone||`

This way your whole message shows up in the notification
